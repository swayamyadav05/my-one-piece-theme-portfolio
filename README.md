# Swayam's One Piece Inspired Portfolio

## Why a One Piece Theme?

Most portfolios follow a professional, minimal, or ultra-modern aesthetic. I chose to break the mold and create a portfolio inspired by One Piece‚Äîa legendary anime about adventure, dreams, and the courage to chart your own course. Here's why:

One Piece has been a source of inspiration for me, teaching lessons about perseverance, friendship, and daring to dream big. I wanted my portfolio to reflect not just my skills, but my story and the values that drive me.
Rather than blending in with generic templates, I wanted my portfolio to stand out and feel truly mine. The pirate theme, playful elements, and references to the Straw Hat crew make my site memorable and authentic.
Like the journey in One Piece, my career is an adventure‚Äîfull of learning, challenges, and growth. The portfolio's design captures this spirit, inviting visitors to explore my projects as if they were treasures on a map.
Encouraging visitors to stay longer and connect with my personality beyond just my resume.

## Things I Learned While Making This

-   How to design and implement custom animated backgrounds and character silhouettes using CSS and JavaScript
-   The importance of storytelling and theming in web design to create a memorable user experience
-   Advanced CSS techniques for responsive layouts and smooth transitions
-   Integrating third-party libraries (Font Awesome, Google Fonts, EmailJS) for enhanced functionality
-   Building interactive UI components (navigation, project showcases, easter eggs) from scratch
-   Deploying a modern web app using Vercel and optimizing for performance
-   Balancing creativity with usability‚Äîmaking sure the site is both fun and professional
-   How to express my personality and interests through code, not just content

**AI Integration & Den Den Mushi Chatbot:**

-   Architected a pirate-themed AI assistant (‚ÄúDen Den Mushi‚Äù üêå) as an interactive chat widget, blending One Piece lore with modern web tech.
-   Implemented a full-stack AI chat system:
    -   **Frontend:** Custom JavaScript class (`PirateAI`) for chat UI, message handling, and pirate-style responses.
    -   **Backend:** API route (`/api/chat`) that securely proxies user queries to OpenRouter's LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek, GPT-4o) with context about the portfolio and developer.
-   Crafted a rich, in-character system prompt so the AI responds as a pirate mate, referencing Swayam's journey, skills, and One Piece themes.
-   Explored prompt engineering, context management, and user experience design for AI-driven portfolio interactions.
-   Used the Den Den Mushi as both a playful design element and a functional contact/chatbot system, making the portfolio more engaging and memorable.
